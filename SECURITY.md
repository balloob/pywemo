## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a significant vulnerability, or evidence of one, please report it privately.

We prefer that you use [the GitHub mechanism for privately reporting a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Under the [main repository's security tab](https://github.com/pywemo/pywemo/security), click "Report a vulnerability" to open the advisory form.

We will gladly give credit to anyone who reports a vulnerability so that we can fix it. If you want to remain anonymous or pseudonymous instead, please let us know that; we will gladly respect your wishes.

We gladly welcome patches to fix such vulnerabilities! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pywemo/pywemo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about contributions.
