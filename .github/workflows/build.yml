  # Coverage reporting is its own step so it can optionally fail if coveralls
  # is experiencing issues. pyWeMo doesn't currently have any logic that is
  # different between Python versions, so the coverage output from only one
  # version needs to be reported. Change the artifact name to use the coverage
  # from a different matrix build version.
